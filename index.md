## I'm Derek. 

I'm a husband to the best wife and a dad to the best son, and I do a lot of things.

## I make web.

The full stack, from backend to UX. I do [consulting for clients](/contact), I like using all sorts of technologies, but I specialize in Drupal. Where development meets rich content is where I like to be. I have a leadership role building the University of Calgary's web experience.

## I take photographs.

Okay, everyone takes photographs. But I've been absolutely privileged to be able to take photos for *other* people. [Check out my work](http://photographybyderek.com), and [the blog](http://photographybyderek.com/blog/).

## I care about community.

When I get a chance, [I blog about civic issues](http://calgaryurbanite.com), which regrettably is not very often. I [co-founded a non-profit once](http://myworldmychoice.org). We ran a school program to teach students about economic, social and environmental sustainability. It was awesome, the kids were amazing.
